    This App was developed as a part of my Master Thesis in 2018 and then redesigned at my study
    abroad. Its purpose is to enable easy cross-platform-learning with flash cards.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://pauker.sourceforge.net/">Pauker</a> is a text based flash card application.
    It uses a combination of ultra-short term, short term, and long term memory. <br>
    Mobile Pauker++ is an Android version of Pauker and compatible with the version 1.7 and above.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>It is very easy to use. You have the choice to</p>
<ul>
    <li>add immediately cards and then save the Lesson, or</li>
    <li>associate the App with your
        <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a> account.
        Dropbox creates a folder at your account at "Apps" called "Mobile Pauker++". Then just save
        your lesson on your PC in this folder and synchronise them.
    </li>
</ul>

    Thanks also to the developer of the open source Pauker for creating such a awesome
    application.
